### Donation Form | ContactUs.com ###

The **“Donation Form”** by ContactUs.com adds a simple donation tab and payment form integrated with PayPal onto your WordPress installation.  The donation plugin is easy and fast to install, and effortless for your users or website visitors. The Donation Form is integrated with a free ContactUs.com account which you can create from within the plugin.
 
Your free ContactUs.com web app account will enable you to track donations, communicate with donors and use ContactUs.com’s advanced web analytics. 
We also provide free support for our Donation Form ( and our other WordPress plugins!) and hope that you’ll reach out if you have any problems or if you would like to see any new features. Our support details are below -- they include free one-on-one chat sessions during regular business hours so we can help solve any of your problems in a matter of minutes. The best part about the donation Form is that it integrates with our free web app, giving your donation form all of the power provided by ContactUs.com. You can see some of our other WP Plugins **[here](https://www.facebook.com/ContactUscom)**.

**The Donation Form works with PayPal**, and it can be used to receive payments from existing PayPal users, and it can also receive credit card payments using PayPal’s merchant portal. The plugin works by placing a donation call-out tab, and then serving a donation form which you can customize from within ContactUs.com. Additionally, you’ll  be able to configure donation notification options, form customization options, contact management tools, third party integrations and more!

Donation Tab Customization
As with all our forms, the Donation Form is fully-customizable, enabling you to create custom tab messaging, add a tooltip message and try out different color schemes that best fit with your website design. 
Donation Form Customization
With the release of the Donation Form we have added quite a few customization options, including:
*Header 
* Link to specific website
* Form Name
* Call to Action
* Define Required Fields
* Preset Templates *We are working on the next 4 templates, only one is available right now. 
* Donation Form and Tab A/B Testing

For our more web-savvy users, you can also run Donation A/B optimization tests to better convert your website visitors into donors. With our optimization tools, you’ll be able to run experiments to see which donation tabs and forms generate more donations. And we make it easy to learn how to optimize. *Check out Donation Plugin A/B testing, below.  

**Donation Form Analytics**

The Donation Plugin  lets you store important optimization information, such as what URL in your website provided the donation, contact information, how many views each donation TAB has gotten, how many opens, how many leads generated from the donations tab. 
Donation Form Delivery Options, Thank You page & Auto Responder 
With the Donation Form you can specify e-mail delivery options, an automated response, a thank you page URL or just customize the content of a default thank you page.
